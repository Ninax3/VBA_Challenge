The “AllStocksAnalysisRefactored” script was notably quicker than the original “AllStocksAnalysis” script by ??? seconds. This is due to the refactored code which has more concise steps and loops using the “Index” code.

## Summary

The advantages of refactoring code is it becomes easier to understand and read. It also becomes less complex and easier to maintain.
The disadvantages of refactoring code is it takes time to edit (refactor) the code that is already written and usable. There is no guarantee of success. 

In relation to the VBA_Challenge scripts, the refactored code is more concise and less wordy. As a result, the script performs better as it takes less time to complete. In addition, the refactored code makes it easy to add more stocks to the index and/or more entries to each index. Another advantage with the refactored code is, one button can be created to include all of the elements the client requested displaying user-friendly data. A disadvantage of the original code is it did not include formatting of cells and had it as a separate subroutine.
